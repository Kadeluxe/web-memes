# WEB DEV MEMES
**My personal playground!**  

## Current ~~mess~~ memes:
### Monorepo
Structure: frontend / backend / libs  
An attempt to make IDE and TypeScript happy with PROPER IntelliSense and refactoring.  
**GIANT HACK (maybe not):** composite TypeScript projects WITHOUT Yarn symlinks, imports are done directly from project sources.  
Import path rewrites happen in Webpack (OK) for frontend and Node **runtime (_WTF?_)** for backend.  

### TypeScript 
Strict TS for all code

### Webpack 5, Vue 3
Custom build scripts, no 3rd party libs or frameworks for Vue  

### Express  
Backend uses Express

### Recall (custom RPC, WIP)
Wow! No more REST, GraphQL, etc!  
Using completely NON-STANDARD way to perform client-server communication!  
_Work in progress_

## Why?
Just experimenting with some approaches to develop fullstack web apps.  
**IT'S ALL JOKE!  
Don't use any of this in production...**
